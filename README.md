A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure 
the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of 
digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.
Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively,
at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known.
Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease production of currency, placing an ultimate cap on the total 
amount of currency that will ever be in circulation, mimicking precious metals.
Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, 
cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.
Cryptocurrency networks display a marked lack of regulation that attracts many users who seek decentralized exchange and
use of currency.
Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems.
